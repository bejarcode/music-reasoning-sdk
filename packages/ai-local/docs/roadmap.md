## 🔨 v0.2.0 - Week 3-4 (November 2025)

**Status**: In Progress

### High Priority

#### 1. Integration Test Validation

- [ ] Run 26 integration tests with v4.5 model
- [ ] Validate 87.5% accuracy claim (G7 chord test)
- [ ] Benchmark inference times (M1/M2, RTX, CPU)
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md with results

**Why**: Empirical validation of research claims before SDK integration.

#### 2. Hardware Benchmarking

- [ ] M1/M2 MacBook (Metal acceleration)
  - Target: 2-3s first call, 0.5-2s subsequent
- [ ] RTX 3090 (CUDA acceleration)
  - Target: 2-3s first call, 0.5-1.5s subsequent
- [ ] CPU fallback (8-core)
  - Target: 5-7s first call, 2-3s subsequent

**Why**: Validate constitutional performance requirements (2-7s inference).

#### 3. Examples Validation

- [ ] Run `examples/basic-usage.ts` with v4.5 model
- [ ] Add examples/advanced-usage.ts (performance monitoring, logging)
- [ ] Create examples/batch-processing.ts (large-scale use case)

**Why**: Prevent regressions, demonstrate real-world usage patterns.

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Model Distribution

- [ ] Implement download resumption (fetch API with Range headers)
- [ ] Add progress bar (XDG cache directory)
- [ ] Test on slow connections (56k, 1Mbps, 5Mbps)
- [ ] Add checksum validation (SHA-256)

**Why**: 2.2GB model requires robust download handling.

**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Complexity**: Medium (networking, file I/O)

#### 5. SDK Integration

- [ ] Wire into `packages/sdk` hybrid intelligence layer
- [ ] Add tier-based feature gating (Free = no local AI)
- [ ] Implement graceful fallback (local → cloud on error)
- [ ] Add usage telemetry (opt-in)

**Why**: Enable end-to-end offline functionality.

**Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours
**Complexity**: Medium (cross-package integration)

---

## 🚀 v0.3.0 - Month 2 (December 2025)

**Status**: Planned

### Browser Support (Optional)

#### 6. ONNX Conversion

- [ ] Convert v4.5 GGUF to ONNX format
- [ ] Test with Transformers.js (@xenova/transformers)
- [ ] Benchmark WebGPU inference (Chrome 130+)
- [ ] Compare browser vs Node.js performance

**Why**: Enable browser-based offline inference.

**Estimated Time**: 16-24 hours
**Complexity**: High (model conversion, browser APIs)

**Risks**:

- WebGPU browser support limited (Chrome 130+, Edge 130+)
- 2.2GB model may exceed browser memory on low-spec devices
- Inference may be 2-5x slower than Node.js llama.cpp

**Decision Gate**: Proceed only if utility study shows browser demand.

#### 7. CDN Distribution

- [ ] Upload v4.5 model to CDN (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3)
- [ ] Implement incremental download (chunks)
- [ ] Add IndexedDB caching for browser
- [ ] Test on slow/unreliable connections

**Why**: Enable browser apps to download model on first run.

**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Complexity**: Medium (CDN setup, caching)

---

## 💡 v0.4.0 - Month 3+ (January 2026+)

**Status**: Future Considerations

### Advanced Features

#### 8. Multi-Model Support

- [ ] Support multiple fine-tuned models (v4.5, v4.8, custom)
- [ ] Implement model switching API
- [ ] Add model registry/versioning
- [ ] Test concurrent model loading

**Why**: Enable users to choose model based on use case.

**Complexity**: High (resource management, API design)

#### 9. Streaming Inference

- [ ] Implement token-by-token streaming
- [ ] Add `generateExplanationStream()` API
- [ ] Test with long-form responses (200+ tokens)
- [ ] Add backpressure handling

**Why**: Improve perceived performance for long responses.

**Complexity**: Medium (streaming APIs, generator functions)

#### 10. Quantization Options

- [ ] Support INT8, FP16 quantization (in addition to Q4_K_M)
- [ ] Add `quantization` parameter to `loadModel()`
- [ ] Benchmark accuracy vs size trade-offs
- [ ] Document quantization impact on accuracy

**Why**: Enable users to trade accuracy for size/speed.

**Complexity**: High (model conversion, accuracy validation)

### Research & Validation

#### 11. v4.8 Model Integration

- [ ] Integrate v4.8 model (fixes backdoor progression)
- [ ] Validate 90%+ accuracy (8/8 diagnostic)
- [ ] Update KNOWN_WEAKNESSES config
- [ ] Benchmark performance impact

**Why**: Fix known limitation (backdoor progression 0% → 80%+).

**Depends On**: Phase 3 v4.8 research completion.

#### 12. Utility-Focused Blind Study

- [ ] Execute T016 study (3 cohorts, 10 users, 15 prompts)
- [ ] Collect 4-dimension ratings (Clarity, Confidence, Actionability, Audience Fit)
- [ ] Analyze results vs GPT-4o baseline
- [ ] Publish findings in research.md

**Why**: Validate real-world utility beyond accuracy metrics.

**Estimated Time**: 16 days, $300 budget (see UTILITY-STUDY-BLUEPRINT.md)

## 🔬 Research Questions

### Open Questions

1. **Browser feasibility**: Can 2.2GB model run reliably in browser on typical hardware?
2. **Streaming value**: Do users prefer streamed responses or batch responses?
3. **Multi-model demand**: Do users need model switching, or is v4.5 sufficient?
4. **Quantization impact**: What's the accuracy delta for INT8 vs Q4_K_M?

### Validation Criteria

- Browser support: >70% user base has Chrome 130+ or Edge 130+
- Streaming: User testing shows >20% perceived performance improvement
- Multi-model: >10% users request model customization
- Quantization: <5% accuracy loss for INT8 vs Q4_K_M

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following features are **explicitly deferred** or **out of scope**:

### Not Planned

- ❌ Fine-tuning API (use external tools like Unsloth)
- ❌ Voice/audio input (text-only inference)
- ❌ Image/visual music theory (text-only)
- ❌ Real-time MIDI processing (use deterministic core)
- ❌ Cloud sync for conversation history (offline-first principle)

### Why Deferred

These features either:

- Violate offline-first principle (cloud sync)
- Add complexity without clear user demand (voice, visual)
- Belong in other packages (MIDI → core, fine-tuning → external)
